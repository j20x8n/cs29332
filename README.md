12   points
Short   answers!Consider   the   following   problems.       For    each    problem,    determine    if    it    is    possible    that    there    exists    a   polynomial-time   algorithm   for   solving   that   problem.      Justify   your   answer   using   what   is   currently   know about   their   complexity   classes.

●   n   × n   chess
●   The   Halting   Problem
●   Vertex   Cover

Below   are   a   list   of   runtimes   for   decision   problems.    For   each   runtime,   determine   if   the   corresponding   problem   is   in   P   or   EXP   or   both   or   neither.
1.   T(n) =   (log   n)6
2.   T(n) =   log(n6   )
3.   T(n) =   (6n)6
4.   T(n) =   n +   1000
5.   T(n) =   nn
6.   T(n) =   3n   + n6
7.   T(n) =   3n2   +6
Question   3
27   pointsFor   each   problem   below,   determine   whether   or   not   there   is   a   known   polynomial-time   algorithm   for   solving   the   problem.   You   must   justify   why   there   is   no   known   poly-time   algorithm   OR   identify   a   poly-time procedure   that   solves   the   problem.(a)   Consider   a   the   political   meeting   which   has   n   participants.      There   are   m   issues   which   are   to   be   discussed at the meeting.   Each participant must list exactly two issues that interest them.    The organisers   would   like   select   at   most   k   issues,   so   that   each   person   is   interested   in   at   least   one   of the   selected   issues.
(b)   A   graph   G   has   n   vertices   and   m   edges.    The   problem   is   to   determine   if   G   contains   a   simple   cycle   of length   at   least   3.
(c)      A   graph   G   has   n   vertices   and   m   edges.   The   problem   is   to   determine   if   G   contains   a   simple   cycle   of length   at   least   k
(d)   A   directed   graph   G   contains   n   vertices   and   m   edges.   The   problem   is   to   determine   if there   is   path   from   vertex   s   to   every   other   vertex   in   the   graph.

The   graph   is   not weighted.    The   problem   is to   determine   if there   is   path   from   vertex   s   to   every   other   vertex   in   the   graph,   where   the   number   of edges   in   the   path   must   be   at   most   k.
(g)   A   directed   graph   contains   n   vertices   and   m   edges.   The   problem   is   to   determine   if   G   is   a   DAG.
(h)   An   undirected   graph   has   weighted   edges.    The   problem   is   determine   if   there   is   a   path   that   starts   at   vertex   s   and   travels   to   vertex   t   where   the   sum   of the   edge   weights   is   less   than   k.
(j)   An   undirected   graph   has weighted   edges.    The   problem   is   determine   if there   is   a   path that   starts   at   vertex   s   and   visits   all   vertices   exactly   once,   where   the   sum   he   edge   weights   is   less   than   k.

Recall   the   two   steps   that   are   necessary   in   order   to   show   that   a   problem   is   NP   complete.A set of n people   attend   a   political   meeting,   where   m   issues   are to   be   discussed.    Each person   attending   has   created   a   sublist   of   issues   (selected   from   the   main   set   of   m   issues)   that   they   are   most   interested   in.   The   organisers   would   like   to   select   at   most   k   issues   so   that   each   person   is   interested   in   at   least   one   of the   selected   issues.   The   problem   is   to   determine   if it   possible   or   not.

A   graph   G   consists   of   a   set   of   n   vertices   and   m   edges.   A   specific   vertex   is   labelled   S.    The   problem   is   to   determine   if there   is   a   simple   path   that   starts   at   vertex   S   and   visits   all   other   vertices   in   the   graph.
